collection of things we've lasercut for the space

There's a new drinking rack for 4mm plywood

the xbee light switch got a case that used left over 3mm plywood

bottom 1x2 and 1x1 are for bottom lids for the gifted lasercut boxes, as they had to be reproduced

mountlight is a little support for replacing the internal power supply of the RGB spotlights with a shop bought version
